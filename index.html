            <h2>Who I am ?</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    I am a .NET developer (C# .NET, MsSQL) with experience of working on a variety of windows and web development projects. I work on all aspects of the development life cycle, applying my knowledge of OOP C# principles. My work includes building user-focused, dynamic, innovative and functional cloud based project using responsive / adaptive design and development. I have been also building custom modules on Genesys SDK lately on telecommunications sector. I am constantly looking forward to enhance my knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I developed a Quotation/Offer Management System which converted emails to quotations and created them automatically, saving the employer having to hire two new people.</p>
                <p>
                    I have taken part in a large scale cloud based system which implements Transport management System that is a whole chain of process from supplier to client, automated reservation of shipments and handled enquiries as to tracking / other routine enquiries automatically. This enables effectiveness and raises the pace to handle the volume of queries for the client.</p>
